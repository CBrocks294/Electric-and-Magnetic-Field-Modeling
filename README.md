# Electric-and-Magnetic-Field-Modeling
Model of electric and magnetic field using maxwells equations of an inductor coil

## Project ##
We are doing a physics project to see how inductors in series effect each other and how moving inductor coils closer and further from each other will effect total inductance> To get a better understand we will make a model of the magnetic and electric fields to give us an intuative understanding of the underlying field equations

## Assumptions ##
Due to the complexity of maxwells equations we will use Voltage = L dI/dt to calculate the current in the wire rather than having self interaction. This will simplify lots of the maths. We will then use this current to calculate the magnetic and electric field and discrete points in space and time. These fields are purley a visual representatoin of what is happening.
